The project involves the following steps:

Problem Statement: Identifying the problem statement related to the management of academics and extracurricular activities among students.
Data Collection: Collecting data using various techniques related to the identified problem statement.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing EDA on the collected dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
Data Visualization: Creating various visualizations, such as histograms, pie charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, to gain insights from the data.
Key Insights: Presenting the key insights obtained from the EDA using charts and visualizations.

The project covers various aspects of EDA, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Checking for missing values and duplicates
Analyzing data distributions (numerical and categorical)
Visualizing data using different chart types (histograms, pie charts, bar charts, heatmaps)
Exploring relationships between variables (e.g., year, gender, semester/trimester, participation in extracurricular activities)

The provided document contains the detailed code and explanations for each step of the EDA process, along with the visualizations and insights obtained from the analysis..
